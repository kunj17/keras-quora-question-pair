# keras-quora-question-pairs

A Keras model that addresses the Quora Question Pairs
[[1]](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs)
dyadic prediction task.

## Model implementation

The Keras model architecture is shown below:

![[Keras model architecture for Quora Question Pairs dyadic prediction]](quora-q-pairs-model.png)

The model architecture is based on the Stanford Natural Language
Inference [[2]](http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/snli_paper.pdf) benchmark
model developed by Stephen Merity
[[3]](https://github.com/Smerity/keras_snli), specifically the version
using a simple summation of GloVe word embeddings
[[4]](http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) to represent each
question in the pair. A difference between this and the Merity SNLI
benchmark is that our final layer is Dense with sigmoid activation, as
opposed to softmax. Another key difference is that we are using the
max operator as opposed to sum to combine word embeddings into a
question representation. We use binary cross-entropy as a loss
function and Adam for optimization.

## Evaluation

We partition the Quora question pairs into a 90/10 train/test
split. We run training for 25 epochs with a further 90/10
train/validation split, saving the weights from the model checkpoint
with the maximum validation accuracy. Training takes approximately 120
secs/epoch, using Tensorflow as a backend for Keras on an Amazon Web
Services EC2 p2-xlarge GPU compute instance. We finally evaluate the
best checkpointed model to obtain a test set accuracy of
0.8291. The table below places this in the context of other work
on the dataset reported to date:

## Discussion

An initial pass at hyperparameter tuning by evaluating possible
settings a hyperparameter at a time led to the following observations:

* Computing the question representation by applying the max operator to the word embeddings slightly outperformed using mean and sum, which is consistent with what is reported in [[7]](https://explosion.ai/blog/quora-deep-text-pair-classification).
* Computing the question representation using max also slightly outperformed the use of bidirectional LSTM and GRU recurrent layers, again as discussed in [[7]](https://explosion.ai/blog/quora-deep-text-pair-classification).
* Batch normalization improved accuracy, as observed by [[8]](http://www.erogol.com/duplicate-question-detection-deep-learning/).
* Any amount of dropout decreased accuracy, as also observed by [[8]](http://www.erogol.com/duplicate-question-detection-deep-learning/).
* Four hidden layers in the fully-connected component had the best accuracy, with between zero and six hidden layers evaluated.
* Using 200 dimensions for the layers in the fully-connected component showed the best accuracy among tested dimensions 50, 100, 200, and 300.

## Future work

A more principled (and computationally-intensive) campaign of
randomized search over the space of hyperparameter configurations is
planned.

## Requirements

* Python 3.5.2
* jupyter 4.2.1

## Package dependencies

* numpy 1.12.1
* pandas 0.19.2
* matplotlib 1.5.3
* Keras 2.0.4
* scikit-learn 0.18.1
* h5py 2.6.0
* hdf5 1.8.17

## Usage

This repository contains two different ways to create and run the model.

### From the command line

    $ python3 keras-quora-question-pairs.py

On first execution, this will download the required Quora and GloVe datasets and generate files that cache the training data and related word count and embedding data for subsequent runs.

### As Jupyter notebooks

Simply run the notebook server using the standard Jupyter command:

    $ jupyter notebook

First run 

    quora-question-pairs-data-prep.ipynb

As with the script above, this will generate files for training the Keras model. Then run

    quora-question-pairs-training.ipynb
    
next to train and evaluate the model.
